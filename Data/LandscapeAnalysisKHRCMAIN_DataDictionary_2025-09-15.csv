intro_facility,landscape_analysis_facility_system,,descriptive,"We invite you to take part in this survey, which aims to assess the data collection systems - both electronic and paper-based - used for maternal vaccine safety surveillance. We are interested in the types of indicators collected, data quality, system usability, integration, governance, and privacy measures. Your input, as a representative from the Ministry of Health, a health programme, a facility, or a research institution, is key to understanding the current data landscape. The findings will help strengthen vaccine safety monitoring during pregnancy and support safer immunisation practices. All responses will be kept strictly confidential and used only for this assessment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
